# Why Jaspr + Arcane Jaspr?

This guide helps you understand when Jaspr is the right choice for your web project, especially compared to Flutter web.

## The Core Difference

**Flutter Web** renders your UI to a canvas element. The browser sees a single `<canvas>` tag, not your buttons, text, or links.

**Jaspr** renders to semantic HTML. Your button is a `<button>`, your text is a `<p>`, your link is an `<a>`. The browser understands your content.

This fundamental difference affects everything.

## SEO and Discoverability

### Search Engine Indexing

| Aspect | Flutter Web | Jaspr |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Google Crawling | Cannot read canvas content | Full HTML indexing |
| Page Titles | Manual meta tags | Automatic per-page |
| Meta Descriptions | Complex setup | Simple frontmatter |
| Sitemap Generation | Manual | Automatic |
| Structured Data | Very difficult | Standard implementation |

### Social Media Sharing

| Aspect | Flutter Web | Jaspr |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Link Previews | Requires pre-rendering | Works automatically |
| Open Graph Tags | Complex workarounds | Simple meta tags |
| Twitter Cards | Complex workarounds | Simple meta tags |
| WhatsApp/Telegram Previews | Often broken | Works correctly |

**Bottom Line:** If people need to find your site via Google or share it on social media, Jaspr is the clear choice.

## Performance

### Initial Load

| Metric | Flutter Web | Jaspr |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Bundle Size | 2-5MB+ | 100-500KB |
| Time to First Paint | 2-5 seconds | Under 1 second |
| Time to Interactive | 3-8 seconds | Under 2 seconds |
| Core Web Vitals | Often fails | Typically passes |

### Why This Matters

- **Bounce Rate:** Users leave slow sites. Every second of load time increases bounce rate by 7%.
- **SEO Ranking:** Google uses Core Web Vitals as a ranking factor.
- **Mobile Users:** Large bundles hurt users on slower connections.
- **Conversion Rate:** Faster sites convert better.

### Runtime Performance

| Aspect | Flutter Web | Jaspr |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| 60fps Animations | Yes (Skia) | Depends on CSS |
| Complex UI Updates | Excellent | Good |
| Memory Usage | Higher | Lower |
| CPU Usage | Higher | Lower |

**Note:** Flutter has better runtime performance for complex animations, but most websites do not need this level of performance.

## Developer Experience

### Debugging

| Tool | Flutter Web | Jaspr |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Browser DevTools | Limited (canvas inspection) | Full DOM/CSS inspection |
| Element Inspection | Not possible | Native support |
| CSS Debugging | Not applicable | Full support |
| Network Tab | Works | Works |
| Performance Tab | Limited | Full support |

### Common Web Features

| Feature | Flutter Web | Jaspr |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Browser Find (Ctrl+F) | Does not work | Works |
| Text Selection | Custom implementation | Native |
| Right-click Context Menu | Custom implementation | Native |
| Browser Password Manager | Often broken | Works |
| Browser Translate | Does not work | Works |
| Screen Readers | Requires extra work | Semantic HTML helps |

## Migration Considerations

### From Flutter Web to Jaspr

If you have a Flutter web app that needs better SEO:

1. **Evaluate Complexity:** Simple UIs migrate easily. Complex custom painting does not.
2. **Identify Components:** Most Arcane widgets have Arcane Jaspr equivalents.
3. **Plan Routing:** jaspr_router uses different patterns than Navigator.
4. **Test SEO:** Verify Google can index your new site.

### Keeping Both

Many teams use both:
- **Flutter** for native mobile/desktop apps
- **Jaspr** for marketing site, docs, blog

The Arcane design system ensures visual consistency across both platforms.
